1. Never define a function inside another function (except few cases).
2. Never use a list(for one element) where a variable can work the same.
3. Function name should be short and meaningful.
4. A function should do exactly one task (not necessary but good practice).
5. -0.01 <= bal <= 0.01 this expression is wrong.
6. -0.01 <= bal and bal <= 0.01 this is correct expression.
