1. Write pseudo code.
    - write the approach
    - assume as many things as you want (assume as if a function is given)
2. Write a main function and call the required function inside the main function.
3. Keep the mind calm.
4. Do as slow as possible.
5. Write only when you are sure what it does.
6. Try running a statement in shell to see what it does and experiment.
